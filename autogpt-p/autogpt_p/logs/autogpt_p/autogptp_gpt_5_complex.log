INCOMPLETE_PLAN

I would use the INCOMPLETE_PLAN tool to find a plan that fulfills a sub goal of heating the milk in the oven. This tool will help identify any missing objects or steps needed to achieve the overall goal. 

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk should be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, such as a pot or a microwave.
4. The pot or microwave needs to be in a state where it can heat the milk, which means it should be opened.
5. The pot or microwave should be on a suitable surface for heating, such as the counter.
6. The robot or human should be at the location of the counter to operate the oven.

Based on these steps, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(opened pot0)
(on pot0 counter0)
(at robot0 counter0)
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

        (liquid_warm milk0)
        (in milk0 pot0)
        (opened pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
Your previous answer contained the object milk0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state without using the object milk0:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm pot0)
        (in pot0 pot0)
        (opened pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
The 1st argument of the predicate (liquid_warm  pot0) needs to have the type liquid.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state with the predicate adjusted to have the correct type:

        (warm pot0)
        (in pot0 pot0)
        (opened pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
Your previous answer contained the predicate warm, however this predicate does not exist in the domain. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state using the existing predicate liquid_warm:

        (liquid_warm pot0)
        (in pot0 pot0)
        (opened pot0)

 The user asks "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the milk is in a container that can be heated in the oven.
3. We need to make sure that the oven is open and ready to heat the milk.
4. The milk should be placed inside the oven.
5. The oven should be closed after placing the milk inside to start the heating process.

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven would be:
(opened oven0) AND (in milk0 pan0) AND (closed oven0)

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk should be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, such as a pot or a microwave.
4. The pot or microwave needs to be in an open state to heat the milk.
5. The pot or microwave should be on top of a supporting surface, like the counter.
6. The robot or human should be at the location of the counter to operate the oven.

Based on these steps, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(opened pot0)
(on pot0 counter0)
(at robot0 counter0)
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

        (opened pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (at robot0 counter0)

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot) and the pot in the oven.
3. We need to ensure that the oven is open before placing the pot inside.
4. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (liquid_in milk0 pot0)
   - (on pot0 microwave0)
   - (opened microwave0)
5. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk0 pot0)
      (on pot0 microwave0)
      (opened microwave0)
   )

I would use the INCOMPLETE_PLAN tool to find a plan that fulfills a sub goal of heating the milk in the oven. This tool will help identify any missing objects or steps needed to achieve the overall goal.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:

1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk should be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, such as a pot or a microwave.
4. The pot or microwave needs to be in an open state to heat the milk.
5. The pot or microwave needs to be on top of a supporting surface, like a counter.
6. The robot or human should be at the location of the counter where the pot or microwave is placed.

Based on the above steps, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(opened pot0)
(on pot0 counter0)
(at robot0 counter0)

1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot) and the pot in the oven.
3. We need to ensure that the oven is open before placing the pot inside.
4. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (liquid_in milk pot0)
   - (on pot0 microwave0)
   - (opened microwave0)
5. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk pot0)
      (on pot0 microwave0)
      (opened microwave0)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven is:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (liquid_in milk pot0)
    (on pot0 microwave0)

)
Your previous answer contained the object milk, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "milk" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven without using the object "milk" is:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (liquid_in pot0 pot0)
    (on pot0 microwave0)
    (opened microwave0)
  )
)
The 1st argument of the predicate (liquid_in  pot0 pot0) needs to have the type liquid.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "pot0" is of type "pot" and not "liquid," we cannot use it as the liquid in the "liquid_in" predicate. Let's change the predicate to reflect the correct state. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven without using the object "milk" is:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (liquid_in water pot0)
    (on pot0 microwave0)
    (opened microwave0)

Your previous answer contained the object water, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "water" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven without using the object "milk" or "water" is:

(:goal

I would use the INCOMPLETE_PLAN tool to find a plan that fulfills a sub goal of heating the milk in the oven. This tool will help identify any missing objects or steps needed to achieve the overall goal.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk needs to be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, such as a pot or a microwave.
4. The pot or microwave needs to be in an open state to heat the milk.
5. The pot or microwave needs to be on top of a supporting surface, like the counter.
6. The robot needs to be at the counter to perform the task.

Based on these steps, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(opened pot0)
(on pot0 counter0)
(at robot0 counter0)

This goal state specifies that the apple object should be placed on the table and the human should be at the table. This goal state is a partial representation as it includes less than 5 predicates and focuses on the existing objects and their positions.
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer

Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we cannot include it in the goal state.

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to dine an apple". To determine the desired goal state, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the object requested by the user: In this case, the user requested an apple.

2. Check if the object exists in the scene: Since there is no apple object in the scene, we will ignore this part of the request.

3. Determine the goal state based on the existing objects and their current states: 
   - The apple object does not exist in the scene, so we cannot include it in the goal state.
   - We can include the goal state of the apple being in a bowl on the table, similar to previous examples.

Based on the above steps, the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" would be:
(:goal and (on bowl0 table0) (in apple0 bowl0))

You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:

The user request is "I want to dine an apple". To determine the desired goal state, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the object requested by the user: In this case, the user requested an apple.

2. Check if the object exists in the scene: Since there is a banana in the scene but no apple, we will ignore the apple in the goal state.

3. Determine the appropriate predicates based on the user request: Since the user wants to "dine" an apple, we can assume that the user wants to eat the apple. Therefore, we can include the predicate (consumed apple0) in the goal state.

Based on the above steps, the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" is:
(:goal and (consumed apple0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. 

The desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" is:

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to dine an apple."

Step 1: Identify the object requested by the user - apple0

Step 2: Check if the apple0 object exists in the scene - Yes, apple0 is present in the scene.

Step 3: Determine the goal state based on the user request:
- The apple0 should be in a consumable state (e.g., chopped or sliced) for dining.

Based on the previous examples, the goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" can be formulated as:
(:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (chopped apple0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we will focus on the existing objects to formulate the goal state based on the user request "I want to dine an apple."

Given that the apple0 object is not present in the scene, we can formulate a partial goal state based on the available objects:

(:goal and (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped banana0))

This partial goal state indicates that the user can dine on a chopped banana, which is the closest alternative to the requested apple.

A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to dine an apple". To determine the desired goal state, we need to consider the following steps:

1. Identify the object requested by the user: In this case, the user wants an apple.

2. Check if the object exists in the scene: Since there is an apple in the scene (apple0), we can include it in the goal state.

3. Determine the desired location of the object: The user wants to "dine" the apple, which implies that the apple should be in a consumable state.

Based on the above steps, the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" can be expressed in PDDL syntax as:
(:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (warm apple0))

This goal state includes the apple (apple0) being in a bowl (bowl0) on the table (table0) and the apple being warm.
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we cannot include it in the goal state. 

The correct goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" can be expressed in PDDL syntax as:
(:goal and (in banana0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (chopped banana0))

This goal state includes the banana (banana0) being in a bowl (bowl0) on the table (table0) and the banana being chopped.

1. Identify the object requested by the user: In this case, the user requested an apple.

2. Check if the object exists in the scene: Since the object "apple0" is present in the scene, we can include it in the goal state.

3. Determine the appropriate predicates to represent the desired state: Based on previous examples, we can include predicates such as "in apple0 bowl0" to indicate that the apple is in a bowl on the table.

4. Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax: Based on the above steps, the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" can be expressed as:
(:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer

Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. 

For the user request "I want to dine an apple," the desired goal state can be formulated as:
(:goal and (in banana0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0))

2. Check if the object exists in the scene: Since there is an apple object (apple0) in the scene, we can include it in the goal state.

3. Determine the desired location of the object: The user did not specify a specific location for the apple, so we can assume that the apple should be in a common location for dining, such as a plate or a bowl on the table.

 The user(human) asks: "I want an orange". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is for an orange, but there is no orange object in the kitchen scene. Therefore, we cannot include the state of having an orange in the goal.

2. Since the user requested an orange and there is no orange object in the scene, we cannot include predicates related to the orange in the goal state.

3. The goal state will focus on the existing objects in the scene that can be manipulated to fulfill the user's request.

4. Based on the existing objects in the scene, we can formulate a partial goal state as follows:
   - The plastic_cup1 is on the table0.
   - The tomato0 is in the bowl0.
   - The plate0 is on the table0.
   - The water0 is in the bottle0.

1. The user requested an orange, but there is no orange object in the kitchen scene. Therefore, we cannot include the state of having an orange in the goal.

2. The user requested an apple, which is present in the kitchen scene. Therefore, the goal state would include the predicate (on apple0 table0).

Therefore, the desired goal state based on the user request "I want an orange" would be:
(on apple0 table0)

 The user(human) asks: "Give me a banana". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

A: (:goal and (inhand yoghurt0 human0) (inhand spoon0 human0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "Give me a banana". To determine the desired goal state, we need to identify the current state of the objects in the kitchen scene. 

1. We have a plastic_cup1, milk_cartoon0, cutting_board0, human0, table0, robot0, plastic_cup0, tomato0, bowl0, plate0, apple0, water0, bottle0, and plastic_cup2 in the scene.
2. There is no banana object in the scene, so we cannot include it in the goal state.
3. The user is asking for a banana, but since there is no banana present, we cannot fulfill this request.

Therefore, the goal state for this user request would be to not change the current state as there is no banana object available to give to the user. 

In PDDL syntax, the goal state for this user request would be:
(:goal (and))
There is a logical contradiction in the goal. Dummy. Please correct your answer

I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the goal state for the user request "Give me a banana":

Since there is no banana object in the scene, we cannot include it in the goal state. Therefore, the goal state for this user request would be to maintain the current state without any changes.

Since there is no banana object in the scene, we cannot include it in the goal state. Therefore, the goal state for this user request would be to maintain the current state without any changes.

In PDDL syntax, the corrected goal state for this user request would be:
(:goal (and))
There is a logical contradiction in the goal. Dummy. Please correct your answer

The user request is "Give me a banana". To determine the desired goal state, we need to identify the current state of the objects in the kitchen scene. 

1. We have a plastic_cup1, milk_cartoon0, cutting_board0, human0, table0, robot0, plastic_cup0, tomato0, bowl0, plate0, apple0, water0, plastic_cup2, and bottle0 in the scene.

2. There is no banana present in the scene, so we cannot place it in the goal state.

Based on the current state and the user request, the desired goal state would be to have the banana0 in the hand of the human0. 

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(:goal (inhand banana0 human0))
Your previous answer contained the object banana0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer

The user request is "Give me a banana". To determine the desired goal state, we need to identify the current state of the objects in the kitchen scene:

1. There is a plastic cup1, milk_cartoon0, cutting_board0, human0, table0, robot0, plastic_cup0, tomato0, bowl0, plate0, apple0, water0, plastic_cup2, and bottle0 in the scene.
2. The milk_cartoon0 is opened and on the table0.

4. The plastic_cup1 is on the table0.
5. The tomato0 is in the bowl0 on the table0.
6. The plate0 is on the table0.
7. The water0 is in the bottle0 on the table0.
8. The bowl0 is on the table0.
9. The milk0 is in the milk_cartoon0.
10. The human0 is at the table0.
11. The bottle0 is closed and on the table0.
12. The plastic_cup0 is on the table0.
13. The robot0 is at the table0.
14. The apple0 is on the table0.
15. The plastic_cup2 is on the table0.

Since there is no banana in the scene, we cannot include the state of giving a banana in the goal. Therefore, the goal state based on the user request "Give me a banana" would be to have the human0 inhand the banana0.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an apple

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to have an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to have an apple

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

You are a robotic assistant that tries to help the user achieve their plan.
You are given a representation of the scene and need to determine which tool to use to best help the user achieve their goal.

Scene-Memory:
Objects: banana0,tomato0,cutting_board0,bowl0,milk0,human0,table0,plastic_cup0,plastic_cup1,plastic_cup2,milk_cartoon0,water0,plate0,bottle0

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want dine an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

INCOMPLETE_PLAN: I would suggest an incomplete plan to fulfill the user's request to dine an apple. Since there is no apple in the current scene-memory, I can suggest a sub-goal plan that involves finding an apple or a suitable alternative. This way, we can work towards achieving the user's ultimate goal step by step. 

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate
(free  ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(reachable  ?o - carry ?l - location ?a - actor)
; Describes that ?op is open

 The user(human) asks: "I want dine an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Based on the user's request "I want to dine an apple", the desired goal state can be inferred step by step as follows:

1. The apple needs to be in a consumable state, so it should be chopped.
2. The chopped apple should be in a bowl for consumption.
3. The bowl containing the chopped apple should be on the table.

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator would be:
(:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (on bowl0 table0))

 The user asks "I want dine an banana". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
To conclude the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine a banana," we need to ensure that the banana is in a suitable position for consumption. Based on previous user interactions, we can infer that the banana should be in a bowl or on a plate, ready to be eaten.

Therefore, the goal state for the user request "I want to dine a banana" can be expressed in PDDL syntax as:
(:goal (or (in banana0 bowl0) (on banana0 plate0)))

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an orange

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an orange

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an orange

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Give me a banana

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

 The user(human) asks: "Give me a banana". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: Bring me a yoghurt
A: (:goal and (inhand yoghurt0 human0) (inhand spoon0 human0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "Give me a banana". To determine the desired goal state, we need to identify the current state of the objects in the kitchen scene and what actions need to be taken to fulfill the user's request.

1. Check if there is a banana in the scene. If there is a banana object present (e.g., banana0), proceed to the next step. If there is no banana object, ignore the request as the object does not exist.

2. Determine the current location of the banana object. If the banana is on the table (e.g., (on banana0 table0)), then the goal state would be to place the banana in the hand of the human (e.g., (inhand banana0 human0)).

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Give me a banana" would be:
(:goal (inhand banana0 human0))

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon

User-Request: Give me a banana

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot) and the oven (microwave) to be open and warm.
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (liquid_in milk pot0)
   - (opened microwave0)
   - (warm microwave0)
4. Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk pot0)
      (opened microwave0)
      (warm microwave0)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
My apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

(:goal 
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk pot0)
      (opened microwave0)
      (warm microwave0)
   )
)
Your previous answer contained the object milk, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state without the object "milk" that does not exist in the scene:

(:goal 
   (and 
      (opened microwave0)
      (warm microwave0)
   )
)
Your previous answer contained the predicate warm, however this predicate does not exist in the domain. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state without the predicate "warm" that does not exist in the domain:

You are a robotic assistant helping a user achieve their goal.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION: When objects needed for a task are NOT in the current Scene-Memory, you MUST explore unexplored locations BEFORE trying other tools.

Scene-Memory:
Objects: tomato0,plastic_cup0,plastic_cup1,bowl0,plastic_cup2,human0,milk_cartoon0,bottle0,water0,table0,plate0,banana0,milk0,cutting_board0
Object Relations: opened milk_cartoon0,on bowl0 table0,in tomato0 bowl0,on plastic_cup0 table0,on plastic_cup1 table0,on plastic_cup2 table0,closed bottle0,at human0 table0,liquid_in water0 bottle0,on milk_cartoon0 table0,liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0,on bottle0 table0,at robot0 table0,on cutting_board0 table0,on banana0 table0,on plate0 table0
Unexplored Locations: counter0,refrigerator0,door0,sink0,window0

Available Tools (IN ORDER OF PRIORITY):
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an apple

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate
(free  ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(reachable  ?o - carry ?l - location ?a - actor)
; Describes that ?op is open
(opened  ?op - open)
; Describes that ?cl is closed
(closed  ?cl - close)
(warm  ?co - consumable)
(liquid_warm  ?li - liquid)

 The user(human) asks: "I want an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the scene. Since there is no apple object in the kitchen, we cannot include predicates related to the apple in the goal state. Therefore, the goal state will focus on the existing objects and their states.

Based on the current scene, the goal state can be formulated as follows:
(:goal and (on plastic_cup0 table0) (on bowl0 table0) (on banana0 table0) (on plate0 table0) (on cutting_board0 table0) (on plastic_cup1 table0) (closed bottle0) (on bottle0 table0) (liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0) (on milk_cartoon0 table0) (in tomato0 bowl0) (opened milk_cartoon0) (liquid_in water0 bottle0) (on plastic_cup2 table0))

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to have an apple

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate

 The user(human) asks: "I want to have an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the scene. Since there is no apple object in the kitchen, we cannot include predicates related to the apple in the goal state. Therefore, the goal state will focus on the existing objects and their states.

Based on the current scene, the goal state can be formulated as follows:

 The user(human) asks: "I want dine an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to dine an apple."

Step 1: Identify the object needed - an apple (apple0)

Step 2: Determine the state of the apple - the apple needs to be consumed

Step 3: Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax:

(:goal (and (in apple0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (clean bowl0) (clean apple0) (warm apple0)))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I apologize for the oversight. Let's correct the goal state without using the object apple0:

(:goal (and (in banana0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (clean bowl0) (clean banana0) (warm banana0)))
Your previous answer contained the predicate warm, however this predicate does not exist in the domain. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"

1. The user requested an orange, but there is no orange object in the kitchen scene. Therefore, we cannot include the state of having an orange in the goal.

2. Since the user requested an object that does not exist in the scene, we cannot formulate a goal state related to the user's request.

 The user(human) asks: "Give me a banana". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: Bring me a yoghurt
A: (:goal and (inhand yoghurt0 human0) (inhand spoon0 human0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "Give me a banana". To determine the desired goal state, we need to identify the current state of the objects in the kitchen scene. 

From the initial state provided in the problem, we can see that there is no banana object present in the scene. Therefore, we cannot achieve the goal state of giving a banana to the user as the object does not exist.

Since the banana object is not present, we cannot formulate a goal state for giving a banana to the user in PDDL syntax.
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I apologize for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Give me a banana":

(:goal (and)) 

Since the banana object is not present in the scene, the goal state is empty as there is no way to achieve the user's request.
There is a logical contradiction in the goal. Dummy. Please correct your answer

I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Give me a banana":

This goal state specifies that the banana object should be on the table and the human should be at the location of the banana to fulfill the user's request.

Based on the user request "Pour me a plastic_cup of water", the desired goal state can be determined as follows:

1. The human needs to have the plastic_cup in their hand: (inhand plastic_cup0 human0)
2. The plastic_cup needs to have water in it: (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0)

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax for this user request would be:
(:goal (and (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0)))
Your previous answer contained the object plastic_cup0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object plastic_cup0 does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. 

Therefore, the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Pour me a plastic_cup of water" would be:
(:goal (liquid_in water0 glass0))

To turn the user request "Pour me a plastic_cup of water" into a goal state in PDDL, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the object being requested: In this case, the user is requesting a plastic cup of water.

2. Determine the current state of the objects involved: We know that there is a plastic cup (glass0) and water (water0) in the initial state.

3. Check if the plastic cup is currently in the hand of the human: Since the plastic cup is not currently in the hand of the human, we need to add the condition (inhand glass0 human0) to the goal state.

4. Check if the plastic cup is currently empty: Since the plastic cup is not currently empty, we do not need to refill it.

5. Check if the water is currently in the plastic cup: Since the water is not currently in the plastic cup, we need to add the condition (liquid_in water0 glass0) to the goal state.

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Pour me a plastic_cup of water" is:
(:goal (and (inhand glass0 human0) (liquid_in water0 glass0)))

User-Request: Pour me a plastic_cup of water

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

To turn the user request "Pour me a plastic cup of water" into a goal state in PDDL, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the object being requested: In this case, the user is requesting water to be poured into a plastic cup.

2. Determine the current state: From the initial state provided in the problem, we can see that there is already a plastic cup (plastic_cup0) in the possession of the human (human0) and there is water (milk0) in another plastic cup (plastic_cup0) on the table (table0).

3. Formulate the goal state: Based on the user request and the current state, the goal state should include the following conditions:
- The human has the plastic cup in hand: (inhand plastic_cup0 human0)
- The plastic cup contains water: (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0)

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Pour me a plastic cup of water" is:
(:goal (and (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0)))

I apologize for the oversight. Since the object water0 does not exist in the scene, we will use the existing liquid milk0 instead. 

Therefore, the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Pour me a plastic cup of water" is:
(:goal (and (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in milk0 plastic_cup0)))

   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request "I want a glass of water" implies that the user wants to drink water from a glass. To achieve this goal, the robot needs to ensure that the water is in a container suitable for drinking, such as a glass. 

Based on the current scene and objects available, the goal state can be formulated as follows:
(:goal and (inhand plastic_cup2 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup2)) 

Explanation:
- (inhand plastic_cup2 human0): This predicate indicates that the human has the plastic cup in their hand, ready to drink from.
- (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup2): This predicate specifies that the water is in the plastic cup, making it ready for the user to drink. 

By achieving this goal state, the robot will successfully fulfill the user's request for a glass of water.

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
To conclude that the user's desired goal state is to have a glass of water, we need to analyze the user's request and the current state of the kitchen. The user specifically mentioned wanting water, which implies they want to drink it. Therefore, the goal state should involve the user having water in a container that they can drink from.

Based on the current state of the kitchen and the user's request, the goal state should be:
(:goal (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0))

This goal state ensures that the user has the plastic cup in their hand (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) and that the cup contains water (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0), fulfilling the user's request for a glass of water.

There are no unexplored locations left to explore, and all necessary objects are already in the scene. We can proceed with creating a plan to fulfill the user's request to drink a glass of milk.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates

 The user(human) asks: "I want to drink a glass of milk". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I would like a lactose-free milk
A: (:goal and (in oat_milk_cartoon0 refrigerator0) (liquid_in oat_milk0 coffee_cup0) (inhand coffee_cup0 human0) (closed oat_milk_cartoon0))
Q2: I feel dizzy - open the window and bring me something to drink
A: (:goal and (opened window0) (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0))
Q3: I need to take my medicine - bring me water
A: (:goal and (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) (liquid_in water0 plastic_cup0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Based on the user's request "I want to drink a glass of milk", the desired goal state can be formulated as follows:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (in milk0 plastic_cup0) 
        (inhand plastic_cup0 human0) 
        (liquid_in milk0 plastic_cup0) 
        (closed milk_cartoon0)
    )
) 

Explanation:
1. (in milk0 plastic_cup0): The milk should be in the plastic cup for the user to drink.
2. (inhand plastic_cup0 human0): The plastic cup containing milk should be in the hand of the human.
3. (liquid_in milk0 plastic_cup0): The milk should be in the plastic cup.
4. (closed milk_cartoon0): The milk carton should be closed to ensure the milk stays fresh.

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to drink a glass of milk."

1. Identify the object needed: milk
2. Check if the object exists in the scene: milk is not present
3. Since the object milk is not present, we cannot include the state of drinking milk in the goal state.

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator would be:
(:goal and ())

This means that there is no specific goal state to achieve since the object requested by the user (milk) does not exist in the scene.

Apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator:

 The user(human) asks: "I want to eat a salad with cucumber and salad". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: To eat the cucumber - I'll need cutlery
A: (:goal and (chopped  cucumber0) (or (inhand fork0 human0) (on fork0 table0)) (or (inhand dinner_knife0 human0) (on dinner_knife0 table0)))
Q2: Please assist me in making a salad with tomatoes
A: (:goal and (chopped tomato0) (chopped salad0) (in salad0 bowl0) (in tomato0 bowl0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Based on the previous examples, we can break down the user request "I want to eat a salad with cucumber and salad" into the following steps:

1. Chop the cucumber
2. Chop the salad
3. Put the chopped cucumber in a bowl
4. Put the chopped salad in the same bowl

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(:goal and (chopped cucumber0) (chopped salad0) (in cucumber0 bowl0) (in salad0 bowl0))
Your previous answer contained the object cucumber0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator:

Your previous answer contained the object salad0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state in PDDL syntax without using the ? operator:

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to eat a salad with tomato and salad

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Give me a kitchen knife for cutting vegetables

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

 The user(human) asks: "Give me a kitchen knife for cutting vegetables". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Give me a kitchen knife for cutting vegetables."
2. To achieve this request, we need to provide the user with a kitchen knife.
3. Since the kitchen knife is not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, we need to add it to the goal state.
4. The kitchen knife is used for cutting vegetables, so we can include the predicate "chopped" in the goal state to indicate that the vegetables need to be cut.
5. The vegetables that need to be cut are not explicitly mentioned in the initial state, so we can ignore this part of the request.
6. Based on the above steps, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and
      (inhand kitchen_knife0 human0)
      (chopped vegetables0)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is "Give me scissors to open the package".
2. To achieve this request, we need to provide the user with scissors and ensure that the package is opened.
3. Since there are no scissors or a package in the scene, we can ignore the package part of the request.
4. The goal state to achieve is therefore: (inhand scissors human0) and (opened milk_cartoon0).
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

Your previous answer contained the object scissors, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "scissors" does not exist in the scene, we will focus on the goal related to opening the package. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "Give me scissors to open the package" is:

(:goal (opened milk_cartoon0))

Available Tools (IN ORDER OF PRIORITY):
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Give me a cloth to clean the table

DECISION PROCESS - Follow these steps IN ORDER:
1. Identify ALL objects/items needed for the user's request
2. Check current Scene-Memory for these objects
3. IF ANY required object is missing:
   a. CHECK if there are Unexplored Locations (0 available)
   b. You MUST use EXPLORE <location> FIRST before any other tool
   c. Choose the most logical location (e.g., refrigerator for food, sink for water/containers)
4. ONLY after exploring all relevant locations, consider:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE if object cannot be found
   - PLAN if all objects are now available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as last resort

IMPORTANT: There are 0 unexplored locations. These MUST be explored before declaring objects are missing.

For "heat milk in oven": You need milk (present) AND an oven (NOT present). Since oven is missing and locations are unexplored, use EXPLORE.

DECISION PROCESS - Follow IN ORDER:
1. Review what the last tool accomplished
2. Check if required objects are STILL missing
3. Are there 0 unexplored locations remaining?
   - IF YES and objects missing: MUST use EXPLORE <location> next
   - Choose different location than previously explored
4. Only if exploration exhausted or all objects found:
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE for specific missing item
   - PLAN if everything available
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as absolute last resort

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
Explanation: Since there is no oven visible in the scene memory, a full plan using the available objects is not possible. However, we can create an incomplete plan to achieve a sub-goal related to heating the milk, such as heating it on the stove or in the microwave. This will help move towards the user's request, even if the exact method cannot be followed.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot) and the pot in the oven (microwave).
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (in milk pot)
   - (on pot microwave)
   - (liquid_in milk pot)
   - (opened microwave)
4. Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (in milk pot)
      (on pot microwave)
      (liquid_in milk pot)
      (opened microwave)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot) and the pot in the oven (microwave).
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (in milk pot)
   - (on pot microwave)
   - (liquid_in milk pot)
   - (opened microwave)
   - (warm milk)
4. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (in milk pot)
      (on pot microwave)
      (liquid_in milk pot)
      (opened microwave)
      (warm milk)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven is:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (in milk pot)
    (on pot microwave)
    (liquid_in milk pot)
    (opened microwave)
    (warm milk)
  )
)
Your previous answer contained the object milk, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "milk" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven without using the object "milk" is:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (in pot0 pot0)
    (on pot0 microwave0)
    (liquid_in liquid_warm pot0)

Your previous answer contained the object liquid_warm, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Since the object "liquid_warm" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. The correct goal state in PDDL syntax for heating the milk in the oven without using the object "liquid_warm" is:

(:goal

Result of last tool execution: Planning failed due to unreachable goal

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
Explanation: Since the suggested alternative of a microwave was rejected and the oven is still missing from the scene memory, an incomplete plan is the best option. This tool will help find a sub-goal related to heating the milk that can be achieved with the available objects in the scene.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk should be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, so it should be in a pot.
4. The pot with the milk should be placed in the microwave, which is the oven in this scenario.
5. The microwave should be closed to heat the milk properly.
6. The robot should be at the counter to perform the task.

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(on pot0 microwave0)
(closed microwave0)
(at robot0 counter0)
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
My apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm milk0)
        (in milk0 pot0)
        (on pot0 microwave0)
        (closed microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
Your previous answer contained the object milk0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state without using the object milk0:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm)
        (in pot0)
        (on pot0 microwave0)
        (closed microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
The predicate (in  pot0) needs to have 1 arguments instead of 1.Please change the number of arguments in predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state with the correct number of arguments for the predicate (in pot0):

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm)
        (in pot0 counter0)
        (on pot0 microwave0)
        (closed microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (in  pot0 counter0) needs to have the type contain.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state with the correct type for the second argument of the predicate (in pot0 contain):

For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate
(free  ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(reachable  ?o - carry ?l - location ?a - actor)
; Describes that ?op is open
(opened  ?op - open)

(closed  ?cl - close)
(warm  ?co - consumable)
(liquid_warm  ?li - liquid)
(wet  ?ws - wet-swipe)
; Describes that a consumable ?co is chopped

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to heat the milk, which means the milk should be warm.
3. The milk needs to be in a container that can be heated, such as a pot.
4. The pot needs to be in the oven, which means the oven should be opened.
5. The pot should be on top of the counter, as indicated in the initial state.
6. The robot should be at the counter to perform the task.

Therefore, the desired goal state in PDDL syntax is:
(liquid_warm milk0)
(in milk0 pot0)
(on pot0 counter0)
(opened microwave0)
(at robot0 counter0)
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm milk0)
        (in milk0 pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (opened microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
Your previous answer contained the object milk0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state without using the object milk0:

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm)
        (in pot0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (opened microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
The predicate (in  pot0) needs to have 1 arguments instead of 1.Please change the number of arguments in predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the error. Here is the corrected goal state with the correct number of arguments for the predicate (in pot0):

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm)
        (in pot0 counter0)
        (on pot0 counter0)
        (opened microwave0)
        (at robot0 counter0)
    )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (in  pot0 counter0) needs to have the type contain.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Here is the corrected goal state with the correct type for the second argument of the predicate (in pot0 counter0):

(:goal 
    (and 
        (liquid_warm)
        (in pot0 contain0)
        (on pot0 counter0)

Result of last tool execution: Planning failed due to unreachable goal

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

 The user(human) asks: "I want an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts

Q3: I want to consume some walnuts

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the scene. Since there is no apple object in the domain, we cannot include the state of having an apple in the goal. Therefore, the goal state will be formulated without the apple object.

Based on the user's request for an apple, we can conclude the desired goal state as follows:
(:goal and (on apple0 table0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer

Result of last tool execution: Planning failed due to unreachable goal

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an apple

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to have an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want to have an apple

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want dine an apple

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

 The user asks "I want dine an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
To conclude the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple," we need to follow a similar pattern as the previous user interactions:

1. The apple needs to be in a suitable container for consumption, such as a bowl.
2. The bowl containing the apple should be on the table for easy access.
3. The apple should be chopped for easier consumption.

Based on this analysis, the desired goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" can be expressed in PDDL syntax as:

(:goal (and (in apple0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (chopped apple0)))

 The user(human) asks: "I want dine an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I want to consume some peanuts
A: (:goal and (in peanuts0 bowl1) (on bowl1 table0) (on bowl3 table0))
Q2: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q3: I want to consume some walnuts
A: (:goal and (in walnuts0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0) (inhand nutcracker0 human0) (on bowl3 table0))
Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
The user request is "I want to dine an apple."

Step 1: Check if the apple object exists in the scene. Since the object "apple0" exists in the scene, we can include it in the goal state.

Step 2: Determine the desired state for the apple. Since the user wants to "dine" the apple, we can assume that the apple needs to be consumed. Therefore, we can include the predicate "in apple0 bowl0" in the goal state.

Step 3: Formulate the goal state in PDDL syntax:
(:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (on bowl0 table0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, we cannot include it in the goal state. 

Therefore, the correct goal state for the user request "I want to dine an apple" in PDDL syntax would be:
(:goal and (on apple0 table0))

You are a robotic assistant that tries to help the user achieve their plan.
You are given a representation of the scene and need to determine which tool to use to best help the user achieve their goal.

Scene-Memory:
Objects: tomato0,banana0,plate0,water0,table0,bottle0,milk0,human0,plastic_cup0,plastic_cup1,apple0,plastic_cup2,milk_cartoon0,cutting_board0,bowl0
Object Relations: on banana0 table0,liquid_in water0 bottle0,on plate0 table0,on bottle0 table0,on apple0 table0,on milk_cartoon0 table0,on plastic_cup0 table0,on plastic_cup1 table0,on plastic_cup2 table0,at robot0 table0,closed bottle0,liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0,opened milk_cartoon0,in tomato0 bowl0,on cutting_board0 table0,on bowl0 table0,at human0 table0
Unexplored Locations: counter0,refrigerator0,door0,sink0,window0

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an orange

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user requested an orange, but there is no orange object in the kitchen scene. Therefore, we cannot include the state of having an orange in the goal.

2. Since the user requested an object that does not exist in the scene, we cannot formulate a goal state related to the user's request.

These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user wants an orange, which is not currently present in the kitchen. 
2. To fulfill the user's request, the goal state should include the presence of an orange in the kitchen. 
3. The goal state should be updated to include the orange object. 

Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax for the user request "I want an orange" is:
(orange0 - orange)

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: I want an orange

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

1. The user requested an orange, but there is no orange object in the kitchen scene. Therefore, we cannot include the state of having an orange in the goal.

2. Since the user requested an object that does not exist in the scene, we cannot formulate a goal state related to the user's request.

1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this goal, we need to ensure that the milk is in a container that can be heated in the oven.
3. Looking at the initial state, we see that there is a pot (pot0) on the counter (counter0) which can be used to heat the milk.
4. We also need to ensure that the oven (microwave0) is open so that the pot can be placed inside.
5. Therefore, the desired goal state can be expressed as:
   (and
     (in milk0 pot0)
     (opened microwave0)

INCOMPLETE_PLAN

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN Heat the milk in the oven

Explanation: Since the planning tool failed to find a complete plan to heat the milk in the oven, we will use the incomplete plan tool to find a sub goal that can be achieved with the objects available in the scene.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot or pan) and then heat it in the oven (microwave).
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (in milk pot)
   - (on pot counter)
   - (closed microwave)
   - (on microwave counter)
   - (liquid_warm milk)
4. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and
   (in milk pot)
   (on pot counter)
   (closed microwave)
   (on microwave counter)
   (liquid_warm milk))
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

My apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

    (in milk pot)
    (on pot counter)
    (closed microwave)
    (on microwave counter)
    (liquid_warm milk)
  )

Your previous answer contained the object milk, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the mistake. Since the object "milk" does not exist in the scene, we will exclude it from the goal state. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

(:goal 
  (and 
    (in pot0 pot0)
    (on pot0 counter0)
    (closed microwave0)
    (on microwave0 counter0)
    (liquid_warm pot0)

)
The 1st argument of the predicate (liquid_warm  pot0) needs to have the type liquid.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.

Thank you for pointing that out. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

INCOMPLETE_PLAN

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN Heat the milk in the oven

Explanation: Since the planning tool failed to find a complete plan to heat the milk in the oven, we will use the incomplete plan tool to find a sub goal that can be achieved with the objects available in the scene.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor

; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot or pan) and the oven (microwave) must be open.
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (liquid_in milk pot0) or (liquid_in milk pan0)
   - (opened microwave0)
4. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk pot0)
      (opened microwave0)
   )

 The user(human) asks: "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
1. The user request is to "Heat the milk in the oven."
2. To achieve this, we need to have the milk (liquid) in a container (pot or pan) and the oven (microwave) must be open.
3. The predicates needed for the goal state are: 
   - (liquid_in milk pot0) or (liquid_in milk pan0)
   - (opened microwave0)
4. Therefore, the goal state in PDDL syntax is:
   (and 
      (liquid_in milk pot0)
      (opened microwave0)
   )
Your previous answer did not contain a goal in the correct format. Please correct your answer

My apologies for the oversight. Here is the corrected goal state in the correct PDDL syntax:

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I apologize for the mistake. Since the object "milk" does not exist in the scene, we will focus on the available objects to formulate the goal state.

Given the available objects in the scene, we can formulate the goal state as follows:

(:goal 
   (and 
      (liquid_in water pot0)
      (opened microwave0)
   )
)
Your previous answer contained the object water, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer

INCOMPLETE_PLAN

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN Heat the milk in the oven

Explanation: Since the planning tool failed to find a complete plan to heat the milk in the oven, we will use the incomplete plan tool to find a sub goal that can be achieved with the objects available in the scene.
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Describes the non liquid ?o being in the container ?c
(in  ?o - carry ?c - contain)
; Describes the liquid ?li being in the container ?lc
(liquid_in  ?li - liquid ?lc - liquid-contain)
; Describes the actor ?a being at the location ?l which can also be another actor
(at  ?a - actor ?l - location)
; Describes the object ?o being in the hand of a human or robot ?a. A human can have multiple objects in their hand
(inhand  ?o - carry ?a - actor)
; Describes the object ?ac being carried together by the actors ?a and ?r
(carried  ?ac - assisted-carry ?a - actor ?r - actor)
; Do not use this predicate
(free  ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(reachable  ?o - carry ?l - location ?a - actor)

The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the scene. Since there is no apple object in the domain, we cannot include the state of having an apple in the goal. Therefore, the goal state will focus on the existing objects and their states.

Based on the existing objects in the scene, the goal state can be formulated as follows:
(:goal and (on plastic_cup1 table0) (on plastic_cup2 table0) (opened milk_cartoon0) (on plate0 table0) (on bowl0 table0) (on plastic_cup0 table0) (liquid_in water0 bottle0) (on banana0 table0) (on bottle0 table0) (liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0) (on cutting_board0 table0) (closed bottle0))
New Scene Memory:
Objects: plate0,table0,bowl0,cutting_board0,human0,banana0,plastic_cup0,plastic_cup1,tomato0,plastic_cup2,milk_cartoon0,water0,bottle0,milk0

Unexplored Locations: counter0,refrigerator0,door0,sink0,window0

Result of last tool execution: Planning succeeded

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

User-Request: I want an apple

Lets think step by step. Remember that unexplored locations could contain objects that are relevant to the task.
Only call the planning tool if all utensils are there to fulfill the plan. For example if there is nothing for cutting
the goal "cut the apple" cannot be reached. Which tool would you use?

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s

The user requested an apple, which is not present in the initial state. Since there is no apple object in the scene, we cannot include predicates related to the apple in the goal state. Therefore, the goal state for the user's request "I want an apple" would be:

PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon

User-Request: I want an apple

Lets think step by step. Remember that unexplored locations could contain objects that are relevant to the task.
Only call the planning tool if all utensils are there to fulfill the plan. For example if there is nothing for cutting
the goal "cut the apple" cannot be reached. Which tool would you use?

SELECTED TOOL: INCOMPLETE_PLAN
You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates

 The user(human) asks: "I want an apple". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. 
These are examples from previous user interactions:
Q1: I would like an sliced apple and banana for breakfast
A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts

The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the kitchen scene. Therefore, the goal state would be to have the apple in a specific location, such as on the table. 

The goal state in PDDL syntax would be:

For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates
; Describes ?o being on top of the supporting ?s
(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)

A: (:goal and (in apple0 bowl0) (in banana0 bowl0) (chopped apple0) (chopped banana0))
Q2: I want to consume some peanuts

The user requested an apple, which is not currently present in the kitchen scene. Therefore, the goal state would be to have the apple in a specific location, such as on the table. 

The desired goal state in PDDL syntax would be:
(:goal (on apple0 table0))
Your previous answer contained the object apple0, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Apologies for the oversight. Since the object "apple0" does not exist in the scene, the goal state would simply be to have an apple on the table.

Result of last tool execution: Planning failed due to unreachable goal

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

To heat the milk as requested, I need an oven and milk. The scene has no oven (but does have a microwave), and I also don’t see milk or a microwave-safe container. The best next step is to propose using the microwave instead of the oven; once confirmed, I can search for milk and a suitable container. 
SELECTED TOOL:SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE oven - No oven is present, but a microwave is available to perform the heating task.
Out of the following affordances for a oven, which ones does the user need for the request "Heat the milk in the oven"? The affordances are:
contain: The object is designed to put either objects or liquids inside of it
push:  The object can be pushed away from oneself
pull: The object can be pulled towards oneself
open: The object can be opened
close: The object can be be closed
support: The object provides good support for other objects standing on it
vertical-support: The object can be leaned against safely
heat: The object can be used to make other objects or liquids warmer
heat-resistance: The object can be safely exposed to temperatures over 100 degrees celcius
 End your answer with listing the affordances as strings in a python list format
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
To heat milk in an oven, the oven must be able to be opened, accept and hold the container with milk inside, be closed, and provide heat.

You are the humanoid service robot robotXYZ assisting a human in a kitchen. Your task is to turn the user request into a goal state in PDDL. If an object requested by the user does not exist just ignore it.If an utensil needed to achieve a desired object state is not in the scene do not use that state in the goal. For example do not use chopped if there is nothing to cut in the sceneIf the state needs more than 5 predicates, formulate a partial goal using less than 5 predicates.The predicates of the domain are defined as follows:
(:predicates

(on  ?o - carry ?s - support)
; Do not use this predicate
(indirect_on  ?o - carry ?s - support)

Step-by-step reasoning
- The user’s intent is to heat the milk using the microwave.
- In the scene, milk exists as milk0 and is a liquid: (liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0).
- A microwave is available (microwave0) and is operable (we have predicates opened/closed for it).
- The domain provides liquid_warm for liquids; this is the correct predicate to represent “heated milk.”
- The domain does not provide a predicate to represent “in the microwave” (in is for non-liquids in containers; liquid_in is for liquids in liquid containers, and microwave0 is not a container type). Therefore, we cannot and should not encode “milk in the microwave” in the goal.
- To keep the goal concise and within the predicate limit, we specify only the essential outcome: the milk is warm.

    (liquid_warm milk0)

You are an robotic assistant that tries to help the user to achieve his plan.
You are given a representation of the scene and need to determine which tool to use to help the user achieve 
his goal the best way.

Scene-Memory:
Objects: bottle_opener0,pot0,human0,counter0,paper_towel0,mop0,microwave0,tape0,broom0,watering_can0,cloth0,pan0
Object Relations: at robot0 counter0,on watering_can0 counter0,on microwave0 counter0,on pan0 counter0,on broom0 counter0,on bottle_opener0 counter0,on pot0 counter0,on sponge0 counter0,closed microwave0,on paper_towel0 counter0,on mop0 counter0,on tape0 counter0
Unexplored Locations: coffee_table0,chair0,table0,sink0


Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Lets think step by step. Remember that unexplored locations could contain objects that are relevant to the task.
Only call the planning tool if all utensils are there to fulfill the plan. For example if there is nothing for cutting
the goal "cut the apple" cannot be reached. 
Which tool would you use? End your answer with SELECTED TOOL:<TOOL> <PARAMETERS> and explanation why you choose this tool. 
End your answer with FAILURE if no tool is valid.

We do not yet have any milk or an oven in the known scene. Since these items might be located at one of the unexplored places, the next logical step is to explore one of those areas to search for the required objects. I will start by checking the table, a common place where a container of milk might be found.

All the required objects are available:

– a heat-safe container (pot0 on counter0)  
– an oven (microwave0 on counter0)

 The user asks "Heat the milk in the oven". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step–by–step reasoning  

1. Identify the food item that has to be heated  
   • The user mentions “the milk”.  
   • In the object list the only milk is milk0 – an object of type milk, i.e. a liquid.

2. Find the appliance that corresponds to “the oven”  
   • The problem file does not contain an object called oven.  
   • The only heat-generating appliance present is microwave0 (of type microwave and already equipped with the predicates opened / closed).  
   • In everyday kitchen speech an oven or microwave is often referred to interchangeably when giving informal instructions, therefore we map “oven” → microwave0.

3. Translate “heat” into the predicates of the domain  
   • There is no generic predicate “heated”.  
   • For liquids the domain supplies liquid_warm(liquid).  
   • Therefore heating the milk is satisfied when (liquid_warm milk0) holds.

4. Translate “in the oven”  
   • After heating, the milk (actually its container) has to be located inside the microwave.  
   • The non-liquid object that actually gets put in the oven is the milk carton (milk_cartoon0).  
   • The right spatial predicate for placing a non-liquid object into a container is (in ?o ?c).  
   • Thus we require (in milk_cartoon0 microwave0).

5. Combine the two requirements into one goal state  
   • Both conditions must be true simultaneously, so they are joined with and.

Goal expressed in PDDL

We do not have an oven in the discovered scene, so the request cannot be completed as stated. I can suggest using the microwave (which can heat food) instead of an oven. 

SELECTED TOOL: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE oven
Out of the following affordances for a oven, which ones does the user need for the request "Heat the milk in the oven"? The affordances are:
contain: The object is designed to put either objects or liquids inside of it
push:  The object can be pushed away from oneself
pull: The object can be pulled towards oneself
open: The object can be opened
close: The object can be be closed
support: The object provides good support for other objects standing on it
vertical-support: The object can be leaned against safely
heat: The object can be used to make other objects or liquids warmer
heat-resistance: The object can be safely exposed to temperatures over 100 degrees celcius
 End your answer with listing the affordances as strings in a python list format

To fulfill “Heat the milk in the microwave,” every required item is present:  
– milk is inside the already-opened milk_cartoon0 on table0  
– microwave0 is on counter0 and operational  
– no additional utensils are strictly necessary (the milk carton itself can act as a microwave-safe container)

Therefore a complete plan can be produced.

 The user asks "Heat the milk in the microwave". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning  

1. Identify the object that has to be affected  
   • From the initial state we see that the only milk that exists is milk0, currently inside the opened milk cartoon milk_cartoon0.  
   • So milk0 is the liquid to be treated.

2. Understand the requested state change  
   • The verb “heat” means that, after the task, the milk must be warm.  
   • For liquids the domain offers the predicate (liquid_warm ?li - liquid).  
   • Therefore the goal must assert (liquid_warm milk0).

3. Check if further conditions have to be stated  
   • The user does not explicitly require any other result (e.g. the milk container being in or out of the microwave, the microwave being closed or opened).  
   • The essential and sufficient effect that captures the intention “Heat the milk” is that the milk becomes warm.  
   • Hence no additional predicates are necessary.

4. Translate the conclusion into PDDL goal syntax  
   • A goal in PDDL is given inside a :goal field.  
   • We use an and-expression because goals must be conjunctive unless a single literal is enough; using and with one literal keeps the structure uniform.

Your previous answer contained the object (and, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Find the relevant item  
   • The only milk that exists in the current world is milk0 (already inside the open milk_cartoon0).

2. Interpret “Heat the milk”  
   • In the domain, a liquid that has been heated is represented by the predicate (liquid_warm <liquid>).  
   • Therefore, once the task is finished, the literal (liquid_warm milk0) must be true.

3. Decide whether any additional conditions are required  
   • The user does not ask for any other state change (e.g., the microwave’s door status or the milk’s location).  
   • Making the milk warm is the sole essential effect.

4. Formulate the goal in PDDL  
   • Because the goal consists of a single literal, we can write it directly without wrapping it in an (and …) conjunction.  
   • This avoids introducing the token “and” as if it were an object.

A complete solution is now possible:
– milk is in milk_cartoon0 on the table  
– bottle0 can serve as a microwave-safe container  
– microwave0 is available on the counter  

So we can produce a full sequence of actions to pour the milk into bottle0 and heat it in microwave0.

These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Identify what the user really wants to achieve  
   The sentence “Heat the milk in the microwave” expresses a result, not the concrete actions: when the task is finished, the milk must be hot / warm.

2. Map the natural-language concept to a domain predicate  
   In the domain description the state of a warmed liquid is represented by the predicate  
   (liquid_warm ?liquid – liquid)  
   Milk (milk0) is a liquid object, therefore a successfully heated milk is modelled as  
   (liquid_warm milk0)

3. Check whether additional facts are required  
   • The phrase “in the microwave” merely specifies the means of heating.  
   • The domain, however, has no predicate that explicitly records that something is or was inside the microwave.  
   • After heating, the only observable state change that must hold in every valid plan is that the milk is warm.  
   Consequently, no other goal predicates are necessary.

4. Form the PDDL goal clause  
   The goal is a single conjunct stating that the milk is warm.

You are a robotic assistant that tries to help the user achieve their plan.
You are given a representation of the scene and need to determine which tool to use to best help the user achieve their goal.

Scene-Memory:
Objects: broom0,bottle_opener0,human0,paper_towel0,pot0,microwave0,cloth0,watering_can0,tape0,mop0,pan0,counter0
Object Relations: on paper_towel0 counter0,closed microwave0,on sponge0 counter0,on bottle_opener0 counter0,on microwave0 counter0,on watering_can0 counter0,on tape0 counter0,at robot0 counter0,on pot0 counter0,on mop0 counter0,on pan0 counter0,on broom0 counter0
Unexplored Locations: coffee_table0,chair0,table0,sink0

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

 The user asks "Heat the milk in the microwave". Explain step by step how you concluded that this is the desired goal state. Express the goal state in correct PDDL Syntaxwithout using the ? operator. You are allowed to use disjunctions
These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Find the relevant objects in the initial state  
   • The milk that has to be heated is milk0.  
   • The appliance to be used is microwave0.

2. Translate “…heat the milk …” into a predicate that can hold in the goal state  
   • The domain distinguishes between solid food that becomes warm (predicate warm) and liquids that become warm (predicate liquid_warm).  
   • Milk is a liquid, therefore the goal must contain (liquid_warm milk0).

3. Translate “…in the microwave …” into a spatial relation that can hold in the goal state  
   • In this domain an object that is placed into or onto another object that can support it is represented with the predicate on.  
   • Thus, after finishing the task the milk container (milk_cartoon0) has to be on–i.e. inside–the microwave: (on milk_cartoon0 microwave0).

4. Make sure the microwave is running  
   • A microwave can heat only while the door is closed, therefore the reasonable end configuration is (closed microwave0).

5. None of the three required predicates is true in the initial state, so reaching them represents the change demanded by the user.

The 2nd argument of the predicate (on  milk_cartoon0 microwave0) needs to have the type support.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning 

1. The liquid that has to be heated is milk0 (already inside its container milk_cartoon0).  
2. After heating, the milk must be warm ⇒ use predicate (liquid_warm milk0).  
3. “In the microwave” means the milk carton must be located inside the microwave.  
   • The predicate that puts a (non-liquid) object inside a container is in.  
   • Its second argument must have the type contain, which microwave0 satisfies in the domain.  
   • Therefore use (in milk_cartoon0 microwave0).  
4. For a microwave to run its door must be closed, so the final state should still satisfy (closed microwave0).

These are examples from previous user interactions:

Consider these example in your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning

1. Identify what the user really wants  
   The sentence “Heat the milk in the microwave” expresses a temperature change of the milk; it does not specify any permanent spatial arrangement other than the action should be carried out with the microwave.  
   In the given domain the temperature change of a liquid is modelled by the predicate  
   (liquid_warm ?li - liquid)

2. Select the correct object symbols  
   The milk that exists in the initial state is represented by the object milk0.  
   Therefore, the desired effect is to make the predicate (liquid_warm milk0) true.

3. Check for additional mandatory effects  
   • There is no predicate that explicitly states that something is “in the microwave”.  
   • The microwave is already closed in the initial state [(closed microwave0)], so there is no need to require it again.  
   • All other predicates in the domain deal with cleanliness, chopping, location, etc., none of which are requested by the user.

4. Formulate the goal  
   Since only one condition must hold in the goal state, a single conjunct is sufficient.

Step-by-step derivation of the goal predicates

1. Determine what it means to “heat”.  
   • In the domain the state that something has been heated is captured by the predicates  
     – (warm ?co – consumable) for solid consumables  
     – (liquid_warm ?li – liquid) for liquids.  
   • Milk (milk0) is typed as a liquid, therefore the goal must contain  
     (liquid_warm milk0).

2. “ … in the microwave” tells us where the milk (actually its container, the milk carton) has to end up while being heated.  
   • The predicate that expresses an object being inside a container is  
     (in ?o – carry  ?c – contain).  
   • The milk is held by its carton (milk_cartoon0), and that carton has to be inside the microwave (microwave0):  
     (in milk_cartoon0 microwave0).

3. A microwave can only heat if its door is closed, so the desired final configuration still needs  
   (closed microwave0).  
   (The microwave is already closed in the initial state, so the robot may keep it that way, but explicitly stating it removes any ambiguity.)

4. No other predicates are required by the user’s request.  
   • The user did not ask that the robot stay at any specific place or hold / release anything afterwards, so predicates such as (at robot0 …) or (inhand …) are not part of the goal.  
   • The initial fact that the milk is inside the carton (liquid_in milk0 milk_cartoon0) is already true and does not need to be repeated in the goal.

Putting everything together, the goal is simply the conjunction of the three relevant facts.

SELECTED TOOL: PLAN

I’ll construct a plan that first transfers the milk from the opened milk carton into the empty bottle (glass bottle0 on the counter, which is safer for microwaving than a cardboard carton) and then heats it in microwave0.

Reason: All objects needed for this revised procedure (milk_cartoon0, bottle0, microwave0) are present, so a complete plan should now succeed.

Step-by-step derivation of the goal state

1. Understand the literal meaning of the request  
   The user wants the robot to “Heat the milk in the microwave”.  
   • “Heat” → after the task the milk must be warm.  
   • “in the microwave” → warming shall be achieved by the microwave, therefore the microwave door must be closed while the heating takes place, but the essential, user–relevant effect is still that the milk itself becomes warm.

2. Map the natural-language effects to the available predicates  
   • Warm liquid ⇒ predicate (liquid_warm …)  
     The object to be warmed is milk0, so the literal is (liquid_warm milk0).  
   • The door state of the microwave is already represented with (opened …) / (closed …).  
     The microwave is initially closed, which is the required configuration for heating.  
     We therefore keep (closed microwave0) as part of the desired end situation.

3. Decide which effects are really necessary for the user’s intention  
   The user only cares that the milk ends up heated.  
   Whether the microwave is open or closed after the cycle usually does not matter to the human, but closing the door is a harmless, sensible default and it is already true in the initial state, so we can include it without adding extra burden to the planner.

4. Compile the goal state  
   The minimal but sufficient goal therefore contains:  
   • (liquid_warm milk0) – the milk is heated.  
   • (closed microwave0)   – the microwave is no longer running with the door open.

Previous User Requests:


User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Analyze the user request and identify required objects or affordances to fulfill it completely.
2. Check if all necessary objects are in the current Scene-Memory (Objects and Relations). If any are missing, evaluate if unexplored locations might contain them—do not assume they don't exist without exploring.
3. Prioritize tools as follows:
   - Use EXPLORE <location> if objects are missing and unexplored locations exist that could reveal them (e.g., if a container or tool is needed, explore a relevant location like a table or sink). Choose the most logical unexplored location based on the task (e.g., kitchen-related: sink0 or table0).
   - Use SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> only if exploration is impossible (no unexplored locations) or if substitution is explicitly needed for one object.
   - Use PLAN only if all required objects are present and the full goal can be achieved.
   - Use INCOMPLETE_PLAN only as a last resort if no full plan is possible, no exploration can help, and no single substitution resolves it—focus on a meaningful sub-goal.
   - Use CORRECTION only if the user explicitly asks to remember or adjust behavior for next time.

Remember: Unexplored locations are key—always consider EXPLORE first for missing objects to avoid incomplete plans unnecessarily. For example, if "heat milk" needs a container and none is visible, EXPLORE a location like table0 before suggesting alternatives or partial plans.

Available Tools:
PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds the plan the fulfills the user request. You can only use objects for the plan that are in the List Objects: do not use unexplored locations in the plan
INCOMPLETE_PLAN  - Given the scene memory and the prompt this tool finds a plan that fulfills a sub goal of the user request if it cannot be fully achieved with the objects in the scene.
EXPLORE location - Moves the robot from the current location to the unexplored location location to look for undiscovered objects at that location. (Example Usage: EXPLORE counter3)
SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE missing_object - Ask the user to replace the object missing_object that they requested with another object with the same function. You may only ask for substitution of one object at a time. Example usage: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE spoon
CORRECTION  - This tool should be called when the user asks you to remember and do the same next time

User-Request: Heat the milk in the oven

Think step by step:
1. Review the last tool result and how it affects the scene or progress.
2. Identify any remaining missing objects or affordances for the full goal.
3. If objects are still missing and unexplored locations remain, prioritize EXPLORE <location> to potentially discover them—select a specific unexplored location logically tied to the task.
4. Follow this tool priority:
   - EXPLORE <location> if it could reveal needed items (e.g., don't skip if prior tools didn't resolve missing objects).
   - SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE <missing_object> for targeted substitutions after exploration.
   - PLAN if everything is now available for the full goal.
   - INCOMPLETE_PLAN only if exploration and substitution can't help, and a sub-goal is viable.
   - CORRECTION for user-requested behavioral adjustments.

Unexplored locations are opportunities—use EXPLORE proactively for incomplete setups. For example, if prior INCOMPLETE_PLAN noted a missing oven, EXPLORE sink0 or table0 next.

SELECTED TOOL: SUGGEST_ALTERNATIVE oven
Exploration attempts failed and there’s no oven in the scene, but a microwave is available. I’m suggesting substituting the oven with the microwave to heat the milk.
Out of the following affordances for a oven
Exploration, which ones does the user need for the request "Heat the milk in the oven"? The affordances are:

 End your answer with listing the affordances as strings in a python list format
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
I don’t see the list of affordances to choose from. If you share it, I can select exactly from that set. Based on common oven controls, the likely needed affordances are to open and close the door, place and remove the milk, choose a heating mode (e.g., bake), set temperature and time, and start/stop heating.
