Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Identify the object to be placed: “wine bottle” maps to wine_bottle0 (present in the objects list).
2) Identify the target surface: “top of the drawer.” There is no dedicated drawer object, but wooden_cabinet0 is the only cabinet-like furniture that plausibly contains drawers. Thus, we interpret “top of the drawer” as the top surface of wooden_cabinet0.
3) Map “on top of” to the domain predicate on ?o ?s, which encodes an object being on a supporting surface.
4) Compose the goal: place wine_bottle0 on wooden_cabinet0. No additional predicates (e.g., opened/closed) are required for “on top of.”

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the “drawer”: The only plausible drawer-like storage in the object list is wooden_cabinet0. It is initially (closed wooden_cabinet0), which matches something that can be opened.
- Identify the “bowl”: The only bowl is akita_black_bowl0.
- Interpret “top layer of the drawer”: The domain has no predicates for drawer layers; it only represents open/closed state and containment. Therefore, we model the request as opening the cabinet and placing the bowl inside that cabinet.
- Translate to predicates:
  - “Open …” -> (opened wooden_cabinet0)
  - “Put the bowl inside [the drawer]” -> (in akita_black_bowl0 wooden_cabinet0)
- No extra conditions (e.g., closing afterward) are added because they were not requested.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the target object from “the bowl”: in the objects list, the only bowl is akita_black_bowl0.
- Identify the target support surface from “the stove”: in the objects list, the stove is flat_stove0.
- Choose the appropriate predicate to express “X is on Y”: the domain provides (on ?o - carry ?s - support).
- The user only specifies the final placement; no additional conditions (e.g., robot location, cabinet state) are required for the goal.
- Therefore, the desired goal is that the bowl is on the stove.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- The user’s request “Turn on the stove” maps directly to the domain predicate that represents an object being switched on: turn_on.
- The only stove-like object present in the problem objects is flat_stove0, and it is already present on the table, so it is the correct target.
- No other predicates are required to satisfy the user’s intent (e.g., robot location, cabinet state) because they are plan details, not goal conditions.
- The initial state does not assert either turn_on or turn_off for flat_stove0, so the minimal goal that captures the request is to make turn_on true for flat_stove0.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The request is to place cream cheese relative to the bowl.
- In this domain, placement “on” uses predicate (on ?o ?s) where ?s must be a support. From the init, the bowl itself is placed “on” the table: (on akita_black_bowl0 table0). This shows the bowl is a carried object, not a support surface.
- Bowls are containers; the correct predicate to express a non-liquid inside a container is (in ?o ?c).
- Cream cheese is a non-liquid item in this domain, so the correct spatial relation with a bowl is “in,” not “on.”

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: “Put the bowl on the plate” describes a spatial relation where the bowl should end up resting on top of the plate.
- Identify objects in the problem: the only bowl is akita_black_bowl0 and the only plate is plate0.
- Select the correct predicate: The domain’s predicate (on ?o - carry ?s - support) captures an object being on top of a supporting surface. A plate serves as a support and a bowl is a carryable object, so (on akita_black_bowl0 plate0) is the correct relational goal.
- Exclude other predicates: (in ...) is for containment, not appropriate here; (liquid_in ...) is for liquids; (at ...) is for actors’ locations; (inhand ...) is for being held, which is not the final desired state.
- No extra conditions needed: The request only requires the final relation “bowl on plate,” not constraints about other locations or hand states.

Step-by-step reasoning
- The request is about the final placement of an object, not how it is moved, so the goal should specify a state, not an action sequence.
- The relevant object is plate0, and the reference object is flat_stove0.
- The domain offers spatial relations only via on(o, s), in(o, c), liquid_in, and at(a, l). There is no predicate to express “in front of.”
- Therefore, the closest representable state to “in front of the stove” is to have the plate supported by the stove itself. This is captured by on(plate0, flat_stove0).
- No additional conditions (e.g., at, inhand, open/closed) are required by the user’s request.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The instruction “Put the wine bottle on the rack” specifies a final spatial relation between two known objects.
- In the object list, “wine_bottle0” is the wine bottle and “wine_rack0” is the rack.
- The domain uses the predicate (on ?o ?s) to represent that an object is on top of a support.
- Therefore, the desired final condition is that the wine bottle is on the rack: (on wine_bottle0 wine_rack0).

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Reasoning steps:
- The user intent is to have a storage component “opened.” In this domain, “open” is represented by the predicate (opened ?op - open).
- Among the available objects, the only closable/openable storage-like object present in the initial state is wooden_cabinet0, which is currently (closed wooden_cabinet0). No explicit “drawer” or “middle layer” objects exist in the problem, and the predicate set has no way to reference layers or specific drawers.
- Therefore, the closest achievable goal that matches the request is to have the relevant storage element opened. Since there is only one such candidate, we target wooden_cabinet0.
- The “middle layer” detail cannot be represented with the given predicates and objects; thus it is abstracted to opening the cabinet/drawer entity available.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify target object: “the bowl” uniquely matches akita_black_bowl0.
- Identify destination support: “the drawer” is best grounded to wooden_cabinet0 (the only drawer/cabinet-like furniture present).
- Map spatial relation: “on the top of” corresponds to the predicate (on ?o ?s), which describes an object being on the supporting surface.
- No additional conditions (e.g., opened/closed) are implied by “on top of,” so we only require the placement relation.
- Therefore, the desired world state is the bowl being on top of the drawer/cabinet.
