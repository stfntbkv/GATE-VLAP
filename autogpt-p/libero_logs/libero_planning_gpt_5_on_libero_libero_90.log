Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify the target object: tomato_sauce0 (a non-liquid, carriable item).
- Identify the target receptacle: wooden_tray0 (used as a container to place items “in”).
- Map user intent:
  - “pick up” implies an intermediate inhand state for the robot, but this is not a required final condition.
  - “put it in the tray” specifies the desired final relation: the non-liquid object being inside a container, which matches the predicate (in ?o ?c).
- Choose the correct predicate:
  - Use (in tomato_sauce0 wooden_tray0) because the object is non-liquid and the tray is the container.
  - Do not use liquid_in, on, or any of the disallowed/irrelevant predicates (indirect_on, free, reachable).
- Final goal focuses on the end state only (tomato sauce in the tray), since PDDL goals represent desired final conditions, not intermediate steps.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the two bowls mentioned by the user: akita_black_bowl0 and akita_black_bowl1. Both are currently on table0.
- The instruction “stack the left bowl on the right bowl” requires one bowl to be on top of the other, which corresponds to the predicate on(top_bowl lower_bowl).
- The instruction “place them in the tray” requires both bowls to end up inside the tray wooden_tray0, which corresponds to in(bowl wooden_tray0) for each bowl.
- The problem does not provide any predicate or information to distinguish “left” from “right.” To respect the user’s intent without inventing information, we express the stacking relation with a disjunction: either akita_black_bowl0 is on akita_black_bowl1 or akita_black_bowl1 is on akita_black_bowl0.
- We conjoin the “in tray” requirements for both bowls with the disjunctive stacking requirement so that the final state has both bowls in the tray and stacked in one orientation.

Goal in PDDL

    (in akita_black_bowl0 wooden_tray0)
    (in akita_black_bowl1 wooden_tray0)

      (on akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0)
    )
  )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (on  akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1) needs to have the type support.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Updated goal using the in predicate (so the second argument has type contain instead of support):

(:goal
  (and
    (in akita_black_bowl0 wooden_tray0)
    (in akita_black_bowl1 wooden_tray0)
    (or
      (in akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1)
      (in akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0)
    )
  )
)
There is a logical contradiction in the goal. an object can only be in one other object. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
You’re right. To avoid any object being in two containers, we model stacking as nesting and require only the outer bowl to be in the tray. Because “left/right” is unspecified, we keep both stack orientations via a disjunction.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the item to move: “the ketchup” maps to object ketchup0.
- Identify the destination: “the top drawer of the cabinet.” The problem provides a single cabinet-like object white_cabinet0, already modeled as openable (opened white_cabinet0), and no separate drawer objects exist. Since there is no explicit “top drawer” object, the closest representable target is the interior of the cabinet itself.
- Select the predicate: To represent an object placed inside a container, the domain provides (in ?o - carry ?c - contain). ketchup0 behaves like a non-liquid carried object (it is currently “on” the table), so in is appropriate (not liquid_in).
- Exclude unrelated constraints: The user only asked for the final placement; no requirement to keep the cabinet open/closed or to position the robot is implied in the goal.
- Formulate a ground goal (no variables) using the available objects and predicates.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Map “the black bowl” to object akita_black_bowl0 (its name indicates a black bowl).
- Map “the cabinet” to white_cabinet0.
- The instruction “put … in the bottom drawer of the cabinet” requires a containment relation.
- The domain provides in (?o - carry ?c - contain) to express non-liquid objects being inside containers.
- The problem does not model individual drawers or a “bottom drawer” object; therefore the closest representable goal is the bowl being in the cabinet itself.
- No additional goal predicates (e.g., opened/closed, locations of agents) are necessary to satisfy the user’s request as expressed in the available predicate set. We avoid predicates explicitly marked “Do not use.”

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Reasoning
- The instruction has two sequential actions: pick up the butter, then put it in the basket.
- In this domain, “picked up” corresponds to the butter being in someone’s hand (inhand), but that is an intermediate condition, not the lasting outcome.
- The lasting, verifiable end condition of “put it in the basket” is that the non-liquid butter is inside the container basket, modeled by the predicate (in ?o ?c).
- Butter is a non-liquid and basket is a container; therefore (in butter0 basket0) correctly captures the final desired state.
- We do not constrain who holds the butter during the process, since the goal should reflect only the final state.
- No other predicates (e.g., at, on, opened) are required by the user’s request.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: “put the wine bottle on the wine rack” describes a desired spatial relation between two objects.
- Identify the concrete objects in the problem:
  - “wine bottle” maps to wine_bottle0.
  - “wine rack” maps to wine_rack0.
- Select the predicate that captures “on top of” per the domain: (on ?o - carry ?s - support).
- Formulate the target relation using constants (no variables): the wine bottle should be on the wine rack.
- No additional conditions are strictly required: the planner will move the bottle from its current location (on table0) to the rack; we don’t need to assert negations or hand states.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- The instruction is “put the white bowl to the right of the plate.”
- The domain’s predicates do not include any notion of relative direction (no right/left/next-to). Therefore “right of” cannot be encoded explicitly.
- A common, feasible approximation in this domain is to ensure both objects are on the same support surface, i.e., place the white bowl onto the same surface as the plate.
- From the initial state, the plate (plate0) is on the table (table0). The white bowl (white_bowl0) is currently on the microwave (microwave0), which is not the target surface.
- Thus, the practical goal is to have the white bowl on the table (the same surface as the plate). Including the fact that the plate remains on the table preserves the intended relation without moving the plate.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Map the linguistic structure “put X on Y” to the domain predicate on ?o ?s, which states that an object is on top of a support.
- Identify X = “white mug.” In the object list, candidates that can reasonably be interpreted as white are white_yellow_mug0 (explicitly includes “white”) and porcelain_mug0 (porcelain mugs are typically white). Exclude red_coffee_mug0 because it is red.
- Identify Y = “left plate.” There are two plates: plate0 and plate1. The domain/problem provides no predicate or information about “left,” so we cannot deterministically choose which plate is the left one.
- Because of these two ambiguities (which white mug, which plate is “left”), use a disjunctive goal that accepts any combination of a white mug placed on either plate.
- The initial state shows both candidate mugs are on table0, so achieving any of the disjuncts requires the desired placement action.

Retrying request to /chat/completions in 0.993805 seconds
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- The request mentions “the black bowl at the front” and “the black bowl in the middle.” In the problem, there are three black bowls: akita_black_bowl0, akita_black_bowl1, and akita_black_bowl2.
- The domain/problem does not encode positional descriptors like “front” or “middle,” so we cannot uniquely identify which specific bowl is “front” or “middle.”
- The intended effect is to have the “front” bowl stacked on top of the “middle” bowl, i.e., one black bowl on another black bowl.
- Because we cannot disambiguate which bowl is “front” or “middle,” we encode the goal as a disjunction over all distinct ordered pairs of black bowls: any case where one of the three bowls is on top of another of the three bowls (six possibilities).

Goal state (PDDL):
(:goal
  (or
    (on akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1)
    (on akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl2)
    (on akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0)
    (on akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl2)
    (on akita_black_bowl2 akita_black_bowl0)
    (on akita_black_bowl2 akita_black_bowl1)
  )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (on  akita_black_bowl2 akita_black_bowl0) needs to have the type support.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
You're right: for predicate on, the second argument must be of type support, and akita_black_bowl0 is not a support. To satisfy the typing constraints without changing object types, I switch the predicate from on to in, interpreting the stacking intent as placing one bowl into another. Since “front” and “middle” aren’t encoded, I keep a disjunction over all ordered bowl pairs.

Revised goal (PDDL):
(:goal
  (or
    (in akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1)

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Parse the request: “turn off the stove” indicates a desired end-state where the stove is off.
- Ground the referent “the stove” in the problem’s objects. There is exactly one stove object: flat_stove0 - flat_stove.
- Map “off” to domain predicates. The domain uses (turn_off ?ob - object) to denote an object is off, and (turn_on ?ob - object) for on.
- Ensure unambiguous off state. Since the initial state contains (turn_on flat_stove0), the goal should both achieve (turn_off flat_stove0) and ensure (turn_on flat_stove0) no longer holds.
- Construct a grounded goal with no variables.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: “put the black bowl at the back on the plate” implies a final placement of a specific black bowl onto the plate.
- Map to domain predicates: Final placement on a support is represented by the predicate (on ?o ?s).
- Identify candidate objects:
  - “black bowl” corresponds to objects of type akita_black_bowl: akita_black_bowl0, akita_black_bowl1, akita_black_bowl2.
  - “plate” corresponds to plate0 (the only plate instance).
- Handle the “at the back” qualifier:
  - The domain has no predicate to encode “back/behind” or any fact in the init state distinguishing which bowl is “at the back.”
  - Therefore, we cannot uniquely select one bowl using available predicates.
- Use a disjunctive goal to capture the intended outcome: ensure that whichever bowl is meant by “the one at the back” ends up on the plate by allowing any of the black bowls to be placed on plate0.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify referenced objects: “red mug” maps to red_coffee_mug0; “caddy” maps to desk_caddy0 in the given objects.
- Determine the appropriate predicate: For placing a non-liquid object into a container, the domain provides (in ?o ?c). A desk caddy is modeled as a container, not a surface, so we should use in rather than on.
- Handle unmodeled detail: The “right compartment” is not represented as a separate object or location, so the most precise achievable goal is that the mug is in the caddy.
- Reflect “place it”: Placing implies the object is no longer held. To capture this outcome explicitly, we add that the mug is not in the hand of either actor (robot0 or human0).
- Ensure it’s no longer on the original surface: Since the mug starts on table0, we add that it is no longer on the table to avoid any ambiguity.

Reasoning steps
- Identify the target item: “the chocolate pudding” → chocolate_pudding0.
- Identify the target receptacle: “the tray” → wooden_tray0.
- Map “put it in” to the predicate that expresses a non-liquid object being placed inside a container: in ?o ?c.
- The “pick up” part describes how to achieve the placement, but it is an intermediate action rather than a persistent end condition. The desired final state is that the pudding ends up in the tray.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Parse the request: “put the middle black bowl on top of the cabinet” means we need a specific black bowl to end up supported by the cabinet.
- Map “black bowl” to objects: the problem lists three black bowls: akita_black_bowl0, akita_black_bowl1, akita_black_bowl2.
- Resolve “middle”: there is no spatial information in the state, so the most consistent interpretation is the logically middle identifier among 0, 1, 2, i.e., akita_black_bowl1.
- Map “on top of the cabinet” to the predicate: placing an object on a support uses (on object support). The only cabinet is wooden_cabinet0, which serves as the support surface.
- No other state requirements are implied (e.g., open/closed status is irrelevant to “on top of”), so the goal only needs the on relation.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the target object: “the yellow and white mug” most naturally refers to the single mug object named white_yellow_mug0. There is no separate “yellow mug” or “white mug” in the objects; the only color-indicative mug is white_yellow_mug0. So the request is about one mug, not two.
- Identify the destination: “the right plate.” Two plates exist: plate0 and plate1. The problem does not provide any predicate encoding spatial relations like “right-of,” so we cannot deterministically resolve which plate is “right.” 
- Choose the predicate: “put … on …” corresponds to the predicate (on ?o ?s), where the carried object (mug) should end up on a support (plate).
- Handle ambiguity with allowed disjunction: Since “right” is not encoded, we express the destination as a disjunction over the candidate plates, capturing “whichever one is the right plate in the current scene.”

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: The user wants the black bowl on the left to end up in the tray. “Pick up” describes how to achieve it, but the final desired state is that the bowl is inside the tray.
- Identify objects in the problem:
  - Black bowls: akita_black_bowl0 and akita_black_bowl1 (both are black bowls and currently on table0).
  - Tray: wooden_tray0 (currently on table0).
- Choose the predicate that captures “in the tray” for a non-liquid object: (in o c).
- Handle ambiguity (“on the left”): The initial state contains no information about left/right, so we cannot distinguish which black bowl is “on the left.” To reflect this uncertainty, we express the goal as a disjunction over the two candidate bowls.
- Do not include intermediate actions like “pick up” (inhand) in the goal; they are means, not the end state.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The user’s intent ends with the alphabet soup being placed inside the basket.
- In this domain, a non-liquid object being inside a container is represented by the predicate (in ?o ?c).
- The object is alphabet_soup0 and the target container is basket0, both declared in the problem’s objects.
- The “pick up” part is an intermediate action needed to achieve the final placement, but PDDL goals specify the desired final state, not the sequence of steps to get there.
- Therefore, the minimal and sufficient goal condition is that alphabet_soup0 is in basket0.

Here is how I derive the goal state step by step:

1) Resolve object references:
- “cabinet shelf” maps to the only shelf-like object: wooden_two_layer_shelf0.
- “book on the right” is ambiguous because the problem provides no spatial predicates (e.g., right_of). There are three books: black_book0, yellow_book0, yellow_book1. Therefore, we must allow any of these to be the intended target, using a disjunction.

2) Map “place it under the cabinet shelf” to available predicates:
- The domain has no predicate for “under.” With the given predicates, the closest representable final placement is to put the book inside/under the shelf using in (?o ?c), which describes a non-liquid object being in a container.
- We assume wooden_two_layer_shelf0 can act as the relevant container/location for “under the shelf,” as no other more suitable predicate exists.

3) Final-state focus:
- The user’s request combines “pick up … and place …,” but for a goal state we care about the final configuration: the chosen book should be under/inside the shelf. We therefore express only the final placement, not the intermediate inhand state.

Goal state in PDDL (using a disjunction to handle the ambiguous “book on the right”):

(:goal
  (or
    (in black_book0 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)
    (in yellow_book0 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)
    (in yellow_book1 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)
  )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (in  yellow_book1 wooden_two_layer_shelf0) needs to have the type contain.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
You're right: wooden_two_layer_shelf0 is not a contain object. I’ll change the predicate from in to on so the second argument is a support, which matches the shelf’s type.

Corrected goal state:

(:goal
  (or
    (on black_book0 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)
    (on yellow_book0 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)
    (on yellow_book1 wooden_two_layer_shelf0)

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
1) Identify the referents in the problem:
- “the book” uniquely maps to black_book0 (the only book-like object in the objects list).
- “the caddy” uniquely maps to desk_caddy0.

2) Choose the correct predicate to represent “place in”:
- For a non-liquid object being inside a container, the domain provides the predicate (in ?o - carry ?c - contain).
- black_book0 is a carry object; desk_caddy0 is a container (contain). So (in black_book0 desk_caddy0) correctly encodes “book in the caddy.”

3) Handle “left compartment”:
- The problem’s object list does not include separate compartment objects (e.g., no left-compartment-of-desk-caddy). Since the domain cannot distinguish sub-compartments of the caddy with the given objects, the closest faithful representation is that the book is in the caddy: (in black_book0 desk_caddy0).

4) Exclude intermediate actions from the goal:
- “Pick up” describes how to achieve the goal, not the final state. The goal only needs the end condition that the book is in the caddy.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the referents in the user request:
  - “the book” maps to black_book0 (the only book-like object).
  - “the caddy” maps to desk_caddy0.
  - “right compartment of the caddy” is not explicitly modeled as a distinct object in the problem’s object list (there is no separate right-compartment object).
- Map the requested effects to available predicates:
  - “place it in …” corresponds to the predicate (in ?o ?c), which represents a non-liquid object being inside a container.
- Handle modeling limitations:
  - Since no separate object exists for the right compartment, the closest representable goal is to have the book inside the caddy object itself: (in black_book0 desk_caddy0).
- About “pick up the book”:
  - Picking up is an action the planner will likely perform to achieve the placement. It does not need to be in the goal; the final desired world state is the book being in the caddy.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The user intent “put the white bowl on top of the cabinet” specifies a final spatial relation: object (white bowl) should be on a supporting surface (cabinet).
- In the domain, “on ?o ?s” captures “object ?o is on top of support ?s”.
- Map references to concrete objects in the problem:
  - “white bowl” → white_bowl0 (present in :objects and currently on table0).
  - “cabinet” → the only cabinet-like furniture in the object list is wooden_two_layer_shelf0 (a shelf/cabinet). This is the appropriate support to place the bowl on.
- Therefore, the desired final state is that the bowl is on the cabinet: (on white_bowl0 wooden_two_layer_shelf0).

Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: “open the bottom drawer of the cabinet” implies the desired world state is that the relevant storage component is in an open state.
- Match to available objects: The problem only contains a single cabinet object, wooden_cabinet0. There is no separate object representing a “bottom drawer,” and the domain provides no part-of relation to address subcomponents.
- Choose the appropriate predicate: The domain models open/closed states with predicates (opened ?op - open) and (closed ?cl - close). The initial state includes (closed wooden_cabinet0), so opening it corresponds to making (opened wooden_cabinet0) true.
- Resolve the mismatch: Since no drawer object exists, the closest achievable and semantically consistent goal is to have the cabinet itself opened. This directly operationalizes the user’s intent within the constraints of the domain and object set.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- The object to be manipulated is alphabet_soup0. In the initial state it is (on alphabet_soup0 table0).
- The target specified by the user is “the tray,” which corresponds to wooden_tray0.
- To represent that a non-liquid object ends up inside a container, the domain provides the predicate (in ?o - carry ?c - contain). A tray is a suitable container for a non-liquid item, so the intended final relation is the soup being in the tray.
- The phrase “pick up” describes an intermediate action (using inhand during execution), but the requested final situation is that the soup is in the tray. Therefore, the goal only needs to assert the final placement and does not need to mention inhand or locations.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify objects mentioned by the user:
  - “black bowl” → akita_black_bowl0
  - “plate” → plate0
- Determine the intended spatial relation: “put … on …” means the bowl should end up on top of the plate.
- Map to domain predicates: the predicate that represents an object being on top of a support is (on ?o ?s). Bowls are carry-objects and plates are supports in this domain, so (on akita_black_bowl0 plate0) correctly captures the goal.
- No additional conditions (like hand states or locations) are required by the user’s request; the planner will handle the necessary actions to achieve this on-relation.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning:
- Identify relevant objects in the problem: three books (black_book0, yellow_book0, yellow_book1) and one shelf-like support (wooden_two_layer_shelf0).
- Map the natural-language target “cabinet shelf” to the only shelf/support object available: wooden_two_layer_shelf0.
- The predicate that encodes “placed on [a support]” is (on ?o ?s). So the desired end condition is a book being on wooden_two_layer_shelf0.
- “Pick up … and place …” describes a process; as a goal we capture the final state: the selected book should be on the shelf and not still held. We add (not (inhand …)) for both robot and human to reflect “placed,” and (not (on … table0)) to avoid any ambiguity if the domain doesn’t enforce uniqueness of support.
- “the book in the middle” cannot be uniquely determined from the current state (there is no predicate encoding relative positions). Therefore, we encode this ambiguity with a disjunction over the three candidate books, which is equivalent to “whichever one is the middle.”

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- The task is to “put the butter … in the top drawer of the cabinet and close it.”
- In the domain, containment is represented with the predicate (in ?o ?c), and cabinet open/close status is represented with (opened …) and (closed …).
- The specific notions “back” and “top drawer” are not representable with the available predicates; the closest faithful encoding is that the butter is inside the cabinet. Thus we target (in <butter> wooden_cabinet0).
- The cabinet must end in a closed state, so we include (closed wooden_cabinet0) in the goal.
- There are two butter objects in the problem (butter0 and butter1), and the instruction “the butter at the back” cannot be resolved from the current state (no predicate encodes “back”). To remain faithful without overcommitting, we use a disjunctive goal that allows either butter to be placed inside the cabinet, along with the cabinet being closed.

- Interpret the request: final desired situation is that the mug is no longer held and is placed on the supporting surface to the right of the caddy. The domain has no predicate to encode “right of,” only topological relations like on and inhand.
- Therefore, the closest representable goal is: the mug is placed on the same support as the caddy (table0) and is not in anyone’s hand. Keeping the caddy on the table is also consistent with the request.

Goal in PDDL:

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Parse intent: “turn on the stove” requests a state change to “on” for the stove.
- Map to predicate: The domain provides (turn_on ?ob - object) to represent an object being on.
- Identify the object: The only stove in the problem objects is flat_stove0 - flat_stove.
- Formulate goal: Require flat_stove0 to be turned on. No additional constraints (e.g., location) are implied by the request.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the target objects in the problem:
  - “the book” corresponds to black_book0 (the only book-like object).
  - “the caddy” corresponds to desk_caddy0.
- Interpret the requested outcome:
  - “pick up … and place it …” describes an intermediate handling step (pick up) and a final placement. In a classical planning goal we encode only the desired final state.
- Choose the correct predicate:
  - For a non-liquid object being inside a container, the domain provides (in ?o - carry ?c - contain). This matches “place it in …”.
- Handle “right compartment”:
  - The problem objects do not include any compartment objects (e.g., no right-compartment entity). Therefore, the most precise expressible goal is that the book be in the desk caddy as a whole: (in black_book0 desk_caddy0).
  - If compartments were modeled as separate contain objects, we would target that specific one; since they are not, we encode the closest achievable state.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Identify the target object: “the cream cheese” → cream_cheese0.
- Identify the destination: “the tray” → wooden_tray0.
- Map to domain predicates:
  - Final placement in a container is represented by (in ?o ?c). A tray may also be modeled as a support in some domains; in that case the correct relation is (on ?o ?s). You allow disjunctions, so we can cover both modelings.
  - “Pick up” is an intermediate step (inhand cream_cheese0 robot0) that will occur during planning to achieve the placement, but it should not be in the final goal because the object cannot be both in the tray and in the robot’s hand at the end.
- Therefore, the desired final condition is that cream_cheese0 is placed on/in wooden_tray0. The planner will handle the necessary pickup action on the way from its current state (on cream_cheese0 table0) to the tray.

  - “the cabinet” maps to the existing object wooden_cabinet0.
  - “the black bowl” maps to akita_black_bowl0.
- Map intents to predicates available in the domain:
  - “close the top drawer of the cabinet” must be represented with the available close/open predicates. Since there is no separate drawer object, we target the cabinet itself: (closed wooden_cabinet0).
  - “put the black bowl on top of it” corresponds to placing the bowl on the cabinet as a support surface: (on akita_black_bowl0 wooden_cabinet0).
- Combine both desired outcomes as a conjunction so both conditions hold in the final state.

Step-by-step reasoning:
- Interpret the request: “pick up the orange juice and put it in the basket” implies the final desired arrangement is that the orange juice ends up inside the basket. The “pick up” part describes an intermediate action, not a required final condition.
- Identify the relevant objects from the problem: orange_juice0 and basket0.
- Choose the correct predicate:
  - The initial state uses (on orange_juice0 table0), which indicates orange_juice0 is modeled as a carry object, not as a raw liquid.
  - The predicate for non-liquid items inside containers is (in ?o - carry ?c - contain). The liquid-specific predicate (liquid_in ...) applies only when placing a liquid in a liquid container, which is not the case for a basket.
- Exclude unnecessary predicates: We do not need to assert inhand, at, or any of the forbidden predicates. The user only cares that the orange juice ends up in the basket.
- Minimal goal: Require only that orange_juice0 is in basket0.

Step-by-step reasoning:
1) Interpret the request: “pick up the butter and put it in the tray.” The desired end configuration is the butter being inside the tray; “pick up” describes an intermediate action, not a required final condition.
2) Ground the nouns to problem objects: “butter” → butter0; “tray” → wooden_tray0.
3) Choose the predicate that encodes “inside a container” for non-liquids: in ?o ?c.
4) No additional end conditions are implied (e.g., robot holding the butter), so we only require butter0 to be in wooden_tray0.

HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
High-level reasoning
- The request has two subgoals: make the bottom drawer closed and the top drawer open.
- In this domain, “open/close” states are represented with the predicates opened(...) and closed(...).
- Drawers would need to be individual open/close-able objects (e.g., specific top and bottom drawer objects) to express their states separately.
- The provided problem lists only one relevant openable/closable object: white_cabinet0. No separate drawer objects are defined, so the exact request (one drawer open, the other closed) cannot be represented with the current object set.
- Therefore:
  - The ideal goal (if top and bottom drawers existed as objects) is a conjunction of opened for the top drawer and closed for the bottom drawer.
  - With the current problem, the closest encodable goal that reflects at least part of the request is to have the cabinet open. The “bottom drawer closed” part is not representable without a bottom-drawer object.

Ideal goal (requires drawer objects to exist in the problem)
(:goal
  (and
    (opened white_cabinet0_top_drawer)
    (closed white_cabinet0_bottom_drawer)
  )
)

Closest encodable goal with the current problem definition
(:goal
  (and
    (opened white_cabinet0)
  )
)
Your previous answer contained the object white_cabinet0_top_drawer, however this object does not exist in the scene. Please correct your answer
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request into two target states: bottom drawer closed, top drawer open.
- Map to domain predicates: these states would be represented with closed(...) and opened(...), respectively, applied to the specific openable drawer objects.
- Check available objects: the problem only defines a single open/close-able object related to the cabinet, white_cabinet0. There are no separate objects for a top or bottom drawer.
- Conclusion: the exact intent (one drawer closed, the other open) cannot be represented with the current object set. The closest encodable abstraction is to require the cabinet to be open, which partially reflects “open the top drawer.” The “close the bottom drawer” part is not representable and must remain unspecified.
- Note: The cabinet is already open in the initial state, so this goal may be satisfied without additional actions.

Step-by-step reasoning
- Parse the request: “stack the right bowl on the left bowl and place them in the tray.”
  - “stack … on …” maps to the predicate on ?o ?s (object on support).
  - “place them in the tray” maps to in ?o ?c for each bowl and the tray.
- Ground the mentioned objects using the problem’s objects:
  - The two bowls are akita_black_bowl0 and akita_black_bowl1.
  - The tray is wooden_tray0.
- Handle ambiguity (“right” vs “left”): the initial state does not encode spatial left/right, so we cannot deterministically map which physical bowl is “right” or “left.” To faithfully capture the user’s intent without additional information, we express a disjunction over the two possible assignments:
  - Case A: akita_black_bowl1 is the right bowl and akita_black_bowl0 is the left bowl → (on akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0)
  - Case B: akita_black_bowl0 is the right bowl and akita_black_bowl1 is the left bowl → (on akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1)
- Ensure both bowls end up in the tray regardless of which is right/left by conjunctively requiring:
  - (in akita_black_bowl0 wooden_tray0)
  - (in akita_black_bowl1 wooden_tray0)

Goal state in PDDL
(:goal
  (and
    (in akita_black_bowl0 wooden_tray0)

      (on akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0)
      (on akita_black_bowl0 akita_black_bowl1)
    )
  )
)
The 2nd argument of the predicate (on  akita_black_bowl1 akita_black_bowl0) needs to have the type support.Please change the object or the predicate. Do not change the type of the object you used.
HTTP Request: POST https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions "HTTP/1.1 200 OK"
Step-by-step reasoning
- The predicate on requires its second argument to be of type support. A bowl is not a support in this domain, so on bowl bowl is ill-typed.
- To keep the same objects and satisfy typing, I change the stacking relation between the two bowls from on to in, which is well-typed if bowls are containers: in ?o - carry ?c - contain.
- The user also wants both bowls placed in the tray, which maps to in bowl tray for each bowl.
- “Right” vs “left” is ambiguous in the initial state, so I keep a disjunction over which bowl is “right” and which is “left,” now using in for the nesting relation.

You're right: requiring both bowls to be in the tray while one is in the other creates double containment. To keep stacking and placement consistent, we encode two possible assignments (right/left ambiguity) where the inner bowl is inside the outer bowl, and the outer bowl is in the tray.
